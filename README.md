# Fighting Game

This is a 2D turn-based fighting game written in Python. There are two versions of the game included: "100%" and "125%". The reason for this is that the elements of the game do not display correctly unless the Windows scaling is set to either 100% or 125%. The game is very simple, with only four skills per player, and the skills are the same for both players. There is no character customization or save functionality. The game is played entirely with the mouse.

## Gameplay

The game is a turn-based fighting game between two players. Each player has four skills to choose from, and the skills are the same for both players. The game is played entirely with the mouse.

The objective of the game is to defeat the opposing player by reducing their health points to zero. Each skill has a certain amount of damage it inflicts and a certain amount of energy it costs to use. Each player starts with 100 energy points, and energy is replenished by 10 points at the start of each turn.

During a turn, the player can choose one skill to use against the opponent. The opponent can then choose a skill to use on their turn. The game continues until one player's health points reach zero.
